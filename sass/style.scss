// Here's where we define some default constants
@import "partials/base";

// Then we'll import the compass extension
@import "h5bp";

// Now, you can simply include everything
// (except print and helpers) by uncommeting this line
@include h5bp-normalize;
@import "compass/css3";
@import "susyone";
// Or, you can import the "overrides" partial if
// you want more control over individual mixins
//@import "partials/overrides";

// Finally, put your own styles in these partials
// and add more as needed (i.e. forms, tables, nav)
@import "partials/custom";
@import "partials/fonts";
@import "partials/page";

// Helpers classes should come second-to-last
@include h5bp-helpers;
